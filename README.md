# ASP.NET---MVVM-With-Features-And-Bug-Fixes
The standard projects available to you in Visual Studio 2017 have some bugs that can be difficult to fix, as well as some packages that don't work and play well with some versions of IIS.

## Features:
- Roslyn removed for your convenience.
- Disabled authentication (re-enable by uncommenting out authorization on home controller)
- Removed unused template pages
- Added universal loading icon with example of useage on the Test area page (check the view model under Scripts/app to see use)
- Custom CSS, but keep in mind this is a quick and dirty template, not something for quick and easy styling (might do something later)
